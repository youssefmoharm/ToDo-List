# ToDo-List
The Enhanced Todo List App is a Python-based GUI application that helps users manage tasks. It allows adding tasks with priorities, setting deadlines, and filtering tasks by status (All, Pending, Completed). Tasks are sorted by priority and deadline, with overdue tasks highlighted. Tasks are saved to a file for persistence.
